  Effective communication and interaction between teachers, parents, and students leads to a student’s academic success. “Powerschool” is a website that can help students, parents, and teachers to effectively interact and communicate in regards to academics. Login information such as student and teacher ID is required to access the service. Teachers can assign homeworks with deadlines, make course announcements, send messages to students or parents regarding any concerns. Students can check their courses,  homeworks, due dates, announcements, and send messages to the teachers. Lastly, parents can check the student’s list of courses, homework with grades, and can also communicate with the teacher regarding any concern. Messages exchanged between all parties will be stored in the database along with login information, and grades. “Powerschool” as a website tool will help students, teachers, and parents to interact and communicate effectively.
